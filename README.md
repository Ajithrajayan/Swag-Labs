## Programming Language

* I'm using Java SE version 17.0.3 and it works very well. There are a couple of good reasons to use Java:
* It's been around for a while so there are a lot of solutions for most problems and if not then somebody from the community will be able to suggest an answer quickly.
* It's OpenSource - there are large, well supported communities sharing free libraries.
